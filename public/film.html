    <h1>The Best Movies According to Mai</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of 2024.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. Dune Part 2</h3>
    <p>Masterclass acting, mind bending cinematography, brilliant writing, and overall astounding storytelling can be found in Denis Villeneuve's “Dune: Part Two.” </p>

    <h3>2. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</h3>
    <p>This is an action film. I love the strong women in this movie. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography. </p>

    <h3>3. One Life</h3>
    <p>As it stands, One Life is a fairly unremarkable film about a truly remarkable man. Fresh score. The tear-jerker film that is One Life is an excellent ode to a model of non-violent heroism.</p>
